# Risk-targeted-accel-Northeastern-BR
This repository contains the results of the paper ...

Files' names are organized as follows:
"IM"_GeoMean_b"Dispersion"_"P[C|IMd]"_"pf,T"
"IM" = Risk-targeted intensity measure;
"Dispersion" = Dispersion of the generic fragility function;
"P[C|IMd]" = Collapse probability conditioned to design acceleration;
"pf,T" = Acceptable failure probability;

Matrices with the results are organized as follows:
Column 1 = Longitude;
Column 2 = Latitude;
Column 3 = Risk-targeted acceleration;
